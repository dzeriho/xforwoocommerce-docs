# Standalone plugins

XforWooCommerce standalone plugins install regularly like any other WordPress plugins.

## How to install?

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard. This is typically accessed by adding `/wp-admin` to your website's URL (e.g., www.yourwebsite.com/wp-admin).
2. Once logged in, navigate to the **Plugins** section on the left-hand side menu of your dashboard.
3. Click on **Plugins** to enter the Plugins screen.
4. In the top left corner of the Plugins screen, click on the **Add New** button.
5. On the **Add Plugins** page, click on the **Upload Plugin** button located at the top of the page.
6. Choose the plugin file from your computer by clicking the **Choose File** button, then select the plugin's zip file and click **Open**.
7. After selecting the plugin file, click on the **Install Now** button to start the installation process.
8. WordPress will upload and install the plugin from the file you provided. Once the installation is complete, you'll see a success message.
9. To activate the plugin, click on the **Activate** link that appears after the installation is finished. This will enable the plugin's functionality on your website.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and activated an XforWooCommerce plugin!
