# Introduction

Adoptive filtering is the magic of the Product Filter.

**What's it all about?**

If you need a filter card that adjusts its terms as the customer browsing products, this is the place to get information.

### How does it work?

Basically filters scan products for terms. This is done for more reasons, obviously filtering, but variable products too and as well the adoptive filtering. If we have the data, why not use it.

So, if the option for adoptiove filtering is turned on and the filter card itself has it set, then the magic will happen. Why it needs to be set on in order to work? Well, not all shops need this feature, and it is process and time consuming, so it needs to be turned on when needed. Why on every filter card separetly? Because sometimes you won't have it active everywhere, so this is a convinience thing.
