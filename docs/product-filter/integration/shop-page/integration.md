# Integration

The most common integration is Product Filter on the Shop page. WooCommerce developers and crew want you to use the Shop page, so who are we to argue. But seriously, this is the only proper way to use WooCommerce and most of WooCommerce extensions, so this is highly advised. Anything that the Shop or product archives lack is manageable and there are very few scenarios in which you shouldn't use it. Product Filter works with any setup, but for everything to function in a way it was designed to, and we speak about WooCommerce here, this is the only correct way.

To integrate Product Filter on these pages you can use the Product Filter widget in a sidebar or you can install it using a hooked element to a WordPress action. Third option is a bit of a legacy, but can be useful, the template overrides.
