# Create new product tabs

To add a new tab access the plugin options page. If you use XforWooCommerce visit the **WooCommerce>XforWooCommerce>Product Tabs** page and if you use stand-alone plugin visit the **WooCommerce>Settings>Product Tabs** page for configuration.

Use the **Tabs Manager** to add new tabs.

To add a new tab, click the **Add Item +** button. Before this, select the type of a product tab you need to create. Currently supported tab types are:

- HTML, content, shortcode
- Video
- Image
- Product meta
- Table content render from CSV files

Select the product tab type you want to create and click the **Add Item +** button.

Next, set the name of the tab. Name will be used as tab heading. Other options you can set vary on the type of a product tab you're creating.

For instance, video tab has an option to input a YouTube url. Once set this additional product tab renders video as an embed on product pages.

Tab options are explained in detail in the Tab Types docs section.
