# Image

Adding an image, such as sizing chart, to the product tabs is easy. Follow these steps to add an image to a product tab:

- Set the tab type to image and click **Add Item+**
- Newly created tab will appear in the manager, enter a name for this tab
- Click the **Add+** button to add an image from the WordPress gallery or enter image URL
- Hit **Save** button

Once completed a newly created product tab will appear and show the set image. For more control use the Text/HTML/Shortcode type, if you perhaps need to add multiple images.
