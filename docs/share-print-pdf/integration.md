To further setup the integration visit the plugin settings page.

### Q: Where can I find the plugin settings page?

**A:** Depends on are you using XforWooCommerce package or the stand-alone plugins. If you use XforWooCommerce, navigate **WooCommerce>XforWooCommerce** page to access all plugins settings. If you use stand-alone plugins, then navigate **WooCommerce>Settings>Plugin** (e.g. Product Filter) to access the plugin settings page.

In the plugin settings page of the Share, Print, PDF plugin you can set some basic things, like button style, hide some icons, or add content to PDFs etc.

More options for integration are also available and plugin can be integrated into any template.
