# Print and PDF

Here you can set some basic settings for the printing and PDF generation.

Firstly set your paper size, A4 or Letter or else.

Secondly, you can set the content in the PDFs that'll go just after product heading and at the end of the page. This content will be shown in all generated PDFs. PDFs and printing is generated on the fly (dynamically), so you have nothing to set there, it'll work out of the box.
